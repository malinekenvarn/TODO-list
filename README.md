# Object Oriented Programming: the TODO list

**This is my solution for the third lab in the course Web Development II**

## Goal

The goal for this lab is:

- To understand the basic concepts of object oriented programming
- Learn to use UML diagrams to plan a project
- Learn to create object oriented applications with PHP
- Know how to read and write to external files using PHP

## Functionality

The application will contain following:

- New items can be added to the list, and those will be printed out in the HTML document with PHP
- New items will be stored in an array. The array will be converted to JSON object and stored in a file "todolist.json" (linked in the footer)
- A control will be made to ensure a new todo post is a string with at least 5 letters
- Todos can be deleted (and JSON file has to be uppdated)
- The whole list and JSON file can be cleared
